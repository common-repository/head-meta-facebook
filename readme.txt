facebook meta plugin - 
by Yoni jah <yoni@non.co.il>

This is a very simple wordpress plugin that will add open graph tags to your blog for better support with facebook share.

The main reason I created this plugin was that facebook permalinks with none english letters look really bad (there is a bug in facebook not using urldecode on the url text ) this plugin wiil solve this problem for hebrew language, and I guess that you can easily change it to work with other languages as we'll.

since I any way needed to add a facebook meta to achive this I decided to write a plugin that will handle all facebook open graph as a whole.

this plugin is based on Kaf Oseo (http://szub.net) head meta description  plugin.

INSTALATION -
- edit the head-meta-facebook.php to chnage settings
  you need to add a facebook api number or admin user
  to manage your facebook page (recuirement from facebook )
- upload the head-meta-facebook.php file to your plugin folder

let me know if you use and like this plugin.
